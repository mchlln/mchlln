# Hi, I’m Mathilde 👋  

🎓 I’m a second year Master’s student in **Computer Science** at the University of Bordeaux, specializing in **High Performance Computing** (HPC) and **Data Science**.  
💻 I love working on **distributed systems, software engineering and Machine Learning**, with hands-on experience in **Java, C, Python, and Dart**.  
🔬 I interned at **LaBRI**, where I contributed to **research on peer sampling protocols** – and at **Roxel France**, where I helped to integrate AI in the company, playing with **Machine Learning** and **RAG ingestion for LLMs**.  
✨ When I'm not working, I enjoy **climbing 🧗** and playing **cozy games 🎮**.
